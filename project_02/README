README for Project 02
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this project was to create a PCB design based off of the a PocketBeagle music tuner (see my project 1 folder). Project was completed in Autodesk EAGLE. 
This repository contains my project proposal, a library with the necessary devices, a pdf of the schematic, the EAGLE files for schematic/board, a bill-of-materials, and a gbr file.
Project and wiring was slightly modified from original project and project proposal to optimize routing. 

Steps followed to create project:
    1. Download latest version of Autodesk Eagle
    2. Create a library necessary devices. Each device should have a symbol and footprint. 
       - Hex Display
       - 292303-1 USB Adapter
       - Pocketbeagle
       - Frame
       - Resistor
       - GND
       - CGND
       - LED
       - 5V
       - 1P8V
       - 3P3V
       - Fiducial
       - Mounting hole
    3. Create a schematic using the devices in the library. 
    5. Arrange the devices on the .brd file. 
    6. Upload the design rules file.
    7. Route all the airwires. Change schematics and connections as necessary to ensure proper routing. 
       - for signals: 10 mil trace and 10 mil space
       - for gnd/pwr: 15 mil trace and 15 mil space
       - for vias: 12 mil drill and 24 mil vias
    8. Generate gerber files, then use gerbv to view
