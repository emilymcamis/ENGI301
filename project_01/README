BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
1. Collect necessary hardware
2. Solder the pocketbeagle pins
3. Connect the USB adapter to the breadboard and female USB into the adapter. Then, add the PocketBeagle so that header pin P1_1 is in hole a1.
4. Connect the LEDs to the following pins. Use a 100 ohm resistor for each pin, and make sure the shorter wire of the LED is connected to ground. 
In the orientation of the device, A-F LEDs should be arranged from left to right, and flatter to sharper should be arranged left to right (flatter, 
flat, green/in-tune, sharp, sharper)
LED pins:

blue_led_A="P2_2", blue_led_B="P2_4", blue_led_C="P2_6",

blue_led_D="P2_8", blue_led_E="P2_10", blue_led_F="P2_18",

blue_led_G="P2_20", yellow_led_flatter="P2_22",

yellow_led_flat="P2_24", green_led="P2_33",

yellow_led_sharp="P2_35", yellow_led_sharper="P1_34"

5. Next, connect the HEX display. Connect the "+" pin to a 3.3V input and the "-" pin the ground. Connect C and D to i2c bus 1 (P2_9 and P2_11 
respectively). Add two pull-up resistors: these will connect from either D or C to a 3.3V rail on the breadboard.

OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run code
2. Play tone for 3 sec
3. LEDs and hex display will show frequency and note value
